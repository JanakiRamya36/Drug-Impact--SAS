# Assessing the Impact of a Drug on Fasting Sugar Levels: A Randomized Controlled Study with Three Treatment Groups
## Project Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of Drug A in reducing fasting blood glucose levels among 3,400 patients in a randomized controlled trial. The project aims to determine whether Drug A significantly impacts fasting sugar levels and to explore the influence of factors such as age, financial costs, clinical trial sites and locations. The analysis was conducted using SAS 9.4 and involved several key steps:
1. **Data cleaning:** Ensured data integrity b handling missing values and resolving inconsistencies to prepare the dataset for analysis. 
2. **Exploratory data analysis:** Conducted an initial analysis to summarize key variables and identify patterns.
3. **Statistical analysis:** Performed t-tests, ANOVA, and chi-square tests to assess drug's effectiveness, age-related variations and site differences.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Explored the relationships between financial costs, hospital stays, and fasting blood sugar levels, providing a deeper understanding of the broader economic implications.
## The Data Story
Managing diabetes is a global health challenge, with millions relying on medications to regulate blood sugar levels. This study sought to answer a critical quesion: *Does Drug-A truly make a difference in managing blood sugar?*
While Drug A did not show a significant advantange over a placebo in lowering fasting blood sugar levels, several valuable insights emerged:
- **Age** played a crucial role: Younger and older individuals showed different responses to the treatment.
- **Location** matters: Aizona patients reacted differently to Drug A compared to other regions.
- An **economic dimension** surfaced: Higher treatment costs and longer hospital stays correlated with fluctuating sugar levels, highlighting challenges in accessibility and efficiency of care.
These findings emphasize that healthcare teatments are influenced by a combination of clinical, demographic, and economic factors, and must be understood in a broader context.
